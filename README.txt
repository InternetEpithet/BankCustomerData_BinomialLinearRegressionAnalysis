# Binomial-Linear-Regression-Analysis
This was a group project for my course STAC51, Categorical Data Analysis, a third year course at UofT. This course was taken in the Winter of 2023. For this project I was primarily responsible for model creation. Validation, testing, and putting everything together into a presentable piece is not my primary responsibility. I will nevertheless provide a copy of the final project in its pdf and power point forms.
